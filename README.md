# javascript-challenge

Our goals are:
    Write code that will create a dynamic table based upon  dataset  provided - using JavaScript, HTML,  CSS and D3.js   
    Allow  users to filter the table data for specific values  on the web page.
    
 We created  a  HTML page and an app.js file that will append  the page based on the date searched. 
The JavaScript code listens for events and all columns appear.
