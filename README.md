# javascript-challenge

Our goals are:
    Write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset  provided using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js   
    Allow  users to filter the table data for specific values   on our web pages
    
 We created  a  HTML page and an app.js file that will append the on the page based on the date searched searched. 
The JavaScript code listens for events and all columns appear
